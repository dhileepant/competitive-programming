# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my **competitive programming practice and solutions**, primarily written in **Python**.  
The problems are organized by platform to make it easy to navigate, review, and reuse solutions.

##  Introduction

Competitive programming helps improve problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding efficiency.  
This repository serves as a **personal archive of solved problems** from various competitive programming platforms.

Each solution focuses on:
- Correctness
- Optimal time and space complexity
- Clean and readable Python code
